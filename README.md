React + Vite Project
A simple React app built with Vite to display dynamic greetings and food images

Features
✅ Dynamic Greeting : Displays "Good Morning/Afternoon/Night" based on the user's local time, with color-coded text.
✅ Food Image Gallery : Renders images of favorite foods with consistent styling.
✅ CSS Styling : Uses external CSS (App.css) for styling headings and images.
✅ Modern Setup : Built with Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.

Key Concepts Learned
1. React Fundamentals
JSX : Embedding JavaScript expressions (e.g., {greeting}) in HTML-like syntax.
Components : Building UI with functional components (no class components needed).
State : Using dynamic values (e.g., currentTime) to conditionally render content.
2. Vite Setup
Zero-config : Out-of-the-box support for React (via @vitejs/plugin-react).
Instant Dev Server : Hot-module replacement (HMR) for fast feedback.
Production Build : Optimized bundles with npm run build.
3. Styling
External CSS : Imported globally (import "./App.css").
Inline Styles : Dynamic styles via objects (e.g., style={customStyle}).
4. Dynamic Rendering
Conditional Logic : Using if/else to update content and styles based on time.
Future Steps to Explore
Componentization : Split the app into smaller components (e.g., <FoodImage />).
State Management : Use useState for reactive data.
Routing : Add React Router for multi-page navigation.
Deployment : Deploy to Netlify/Vercel using npm run build.
